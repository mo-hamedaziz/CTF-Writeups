## Preface<br>
This has 37 challenges in total: 8 crypto, 9 misc, 6 pwn, 6 rev and 8 web. <br>
In this writeup, we'll discuss 3 web challenges.<br>
## Web:

This is a simple web game where you can move the dice with WASD keys and you need to catch the black square (the goose). In order to win, the goose and the dice have to overlap, then an alert pops up asking for your name and after submitting you get your score.<br>

When reading the source code, you can find a function,called **win**, that prints the flag:<br>
```
function win(history) {
    const code = encode(history) + ";" + prompt("Name?");

    const saveURL = location.origin + "?code=" + code;
    displaywrapper.classList.remove("hidden");

    const score = history.length;

    display.children[1].innerHTML = "Your score was: <b>" + score + "</b>";
    display.children[2].href =
      "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=" +
      encodeURIComponent(
        "Can you beat my score of " + score + " in Dice Dice Goose?",
      ) +
      "&url=" +
      encodeURIComponent(saveURL);

    if (score === 9) log("flag: dice{pr0_duck_gam3r_" + encode(history) + "}");
  }
```
Specifically, the following line that contains the flag format (the first half of the flag) and prints it to the console:<br>
```
if (score === 9) log("flag: dice{pr0_duck_gam3r_" + encode(history) + "}");
```
This line means if the goose can be caught in 9 moves, then the flag will be printed in the console.<br>So basically the idea is catching the goose in just 9 moves. However, even in ideal conditions, it's impossible to do that by playing the game normally (because of the green barrier which is 9 blocks tall).<br>
In addition, the goose movement is controlled by a random value generated for the switch statement:<br>
```
do {
      nxt = [goose[0], goose[1]];
      switch (Math.floor(4 * Math.random())) {
        case 0:
          nxt[0]--;
          break;
        case 1:
          nxt[1]--;
          break;
        case 2:
          nxt[0]++;
          break;
        case 3:
          nxt[1]++;
          break;
      }
    } while (!isValid(nxt));

    goose = nxt;
```
So replacing the score with a hard-coded value is all that's needed for the solve.<br>
In the **win** function, the score is set using this line<br>
```
const score = history.length;
```
As it's name suggests, history is an array that stores the dice's moves. The idea is clear now, the **win** function must run when the history length is exaclty equal to 9.<br>In order to do that, we have to move the dice 9 times and the execute the **win** function using the console:<br>

In the console, we can see that the history length is now equal to 9.<br>

Now we can execute the **win** function by typing ``` win(history) ``` in the console.It prints the flag just after submitting our name:<br>
